<h1>Brooks Brady<br></h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a freshman in high school hoping to go into computer science.</p>
<p>I know a lot of Java, and I was thinking about doing game development with Unity.</p>
<p>I've always loved playing video games, so I thought "hey, it would be pretty cool to make one".
<p>I've made a few games in Scratch, but I'm going to start a Unity project soon.</p>
